                                     Machine learning is one of the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) that
                                     provides computers, the ability to learn automatically and improve from experience
                                     insteadof explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can
                                     access dataand use it to learn from themselves. The main aim is to allow computers to
                                     learn automatically without human intervention and also adjust actions accordingly.
                                      HealthInsurance had a great deal of attention in financial sector. The prediction of 
                                      premium is a challenging task, which can offer automated prediction about the premium 
                                       so that further policies can be made effective.
